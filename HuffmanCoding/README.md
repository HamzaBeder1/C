Huffman Coding
------
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to take a file and compress and decompress it. This is accomplished by building a Huffman Tree using the characters
in the file and then traversing this tree to obtain the codes associated with characters. These codes can then be used to compress the file, and then 
later used to decompress and get the original file.
